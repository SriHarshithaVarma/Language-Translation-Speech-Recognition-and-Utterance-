# Speech Recognition and Translation

This project focuses on implementing speech recognition and translation functionalities using web technologies. The user can speak into the microphone, and the application will transcribe the speech and translate it into the selected language.
This web application provides the following features:
- Speech recognition: The user can speak into the microphone, and the application will transcribe the speech in real-time.
- Translation: The transcribed speech can be translated into different languages using the MyMemory Translation API.
- Text-to-speech: The translated text can be converted back into speech and played through the browser.

**Usage**

1. **Speak**: Click the "Speak" button to start speech recognition. Speak into the microphone, and the transcribed speech will appear in the "User Speech Content" section. This section is provided for accessibility purposes, ensuring compliance with WCAG standards and enabling users who may have difficulty hearing to access the transcribed speech.

2. **Translate**: After speaking, click the "Translate" button to translate the transcribed speech into the selected language. The translated text will appear in the "Translated Content" section. This section facilitates multilingual communication and ensures inclusivity by providing translations for users who may not understand the original language.

3. **Listen**: Click the "Listen" button to hear the translated text spoken aloud. This feature enhances accessibility by enabling users with visual impairments to listen to the translated content, ensuring a comprehensive and inclusive user experience.

**Run**
 Simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the application.
